# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2023-10-26)

Welcome to turbo-stream, a streaming data transport format that aims to support built-in features such as Promises, Dates, RegExps, Maps, Sets and more.

Shout out to Rich Harris and his https://github.com/rich-harris/devalue project. Devalue has heavily influenced this project and portions
of the code have been directly lifted from it. I highly recommend checking it out if you need something more cusomizable or without streaming support.
